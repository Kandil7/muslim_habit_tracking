# Mobile App System Design: Integrated Life Management Companion

## 1. Overview

### Core Philosophy
To provide a structured, motivating, and integrated digital environment that empowers users to consistently follow their personalized daily plan, focusing on Islamic practices (Ibadah), self-improvement, and skill development (specifically programming), while fostering self-awareness and accountability.

### Key Features
- Dashboard with Today's Overview, Task Progress, and Motivational Snippets
- Daily Planner & Task Manager with structured time blocks
- 'Ibadah Hub for Prayer Times, Adhkar, Quran, and Dhikr
- Skills Hub for Programming with Learning Tracker and Resource Board
- Self-Development & Reflection Hub with Goal Setting and Muhasabah Journal
- Progress & Analytics with Visual Dashboards
- Comprehensive Settings with Theme Customization and Localization

### Project Context
This design builds upon the existing SunnahTrack app, which already implements many foundational features including habit tracking, prayer times, dua/dhikr functionality, Quran reading, and analytics. The new design will enhance and integrate these features into a more cohesive life management system.

## 2. Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Flutter (Dart) - Cross-platform development for iOS and Android (SDK 2.0+)
- **State Management**: BLoC pattern with flutter_bloc ^8.1.3 for predictable reactive state management
- **Dependency Injection**: GetIt ^7.6.7 for service location with singleton and factory patterns
- **Local Storage**: Hive ^2.2.3 with hive_flutter ^1.1.0 for fast, efficient local data storage
- **Networking**: http ^1.2.0 package for API integration with retry mechanisms
- **UI Components**: Material Design with custom Islamic-themed widgets and adaptive components
- **Localization**: Built-in support for Arabic (RTL) and English with app_localizations
- **Error Handling**: dartz ^0.10.1 for functional-style error handling with Either types
- **Charts & Visualization**: fl_chart ^0.66.0 for analytics dashboards with interactive elements
- **Utilities**: uuid ^4.3.3, intl ^0.19.0, equatable ^2.0.5 for enhanced functionality
- **Notifications**: flutter_local_notifications ^16.3.2 for rich notification handling
- **Testing**: flutter_test, bloc_test, mockito for comprehensive testing coverage

### System Architecture
The application follows Clean Architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Presentation Layer**: UI components, state management (BLoC), presentation logic
   - Widgets organized by feature modules
   - BLoC for state management with event-driven architecture
   - View models for transforming domain data to UI-ready data

2. **Domain Layer**: Business logic, entities, use cases
   - Pure business logic without framework dependencies
   - Entities representing core data models
   - Use cases encapsulating specific business operations
   - Repository interfaces defining data contracts

3. **Data Layer**: Data sources, repositories, local/remote data handling
   - Repository implementations bridging domain and data
   - Local data sources using Hive for persistence
   - Remote data sources for API integrations
   - Data models with mapping to/from domain entities

### Data Flow
```
UI (Widgets) → BLoC Events → Use Cases → Repository → Data Sources (Local/Remote) → 
Repository → Use Cases → BLoC States → UI (Widgets)
```

### Design Patterns Implementation
- **BLoC Pattern**: For state management with clear separation of UI and business logic
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracts data sources with interchangeable implementations
- **Dependency Injection**: GetIt for loose coupling and testability
- **Use Case Pattern**: Single responsibility business operations
- **Factory Pattern**: For complex object creation
- **Singleton Pattern**: For shared services like notification and location
- **Observer Pattern**: For reactive UI updates

### Existing Module Structure
Based on the current codebase, the app is organized into the following feature modules:
- **Habit Tracking**: Create, manage, and track habits with goal setting and history
- **Prayer Times**: Fetch and display prayer times using calculation methods
- **Dua & Dhikr**: Dua library and dhikr counter with favorites
- **Quran**: Quran reading interface with bookmarking and history
- **Hadith**: Hadith collection with daily hadith feature
- **Analytics**: Charts and progress insights
- **Settings**: User preferences and app configuration
- **Home**: Main dashboard and navigation hub
- **Onboarding**: First-time user experience
- **Splash**: Initial app loading screen
- **Gamification**: Features to improve engagement and user retention
- **Notification**: Local notification management

  - `constants/`: App-wide constants and configuration
  - `di/`: Dependency injection setup with GetIt
  - `error/`: Custom exceptions and failure handling
